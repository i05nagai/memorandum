## Apache Phoenix
Apache Phoenix enables OLTP and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications by combining the best of both worlds:

the power of standard SQL and JDBC APIs with full ACID transaction capabilities and
the flexibility of late-bound, schema-on-read capabilities from the NoSQL world by leveraging HBase as its backing store
