```
behave [options] [ [DIR|FILE|FILE:LINE] ]+
```

Run a number of feature tests with behave.

* `paths`
    * Feature directory, file or file location (FILE:LINE).


* `-c, --no-color`
    * Disable the use of ANSI color escapes.
* --color
    * Use ANSI color escapes. This is the default behaviour.  This switch is used to override a configuration file setting.
* `-d, --dry-run`
    * Invokes formatters without executing the steps.
* `-D NAME=VALUE, --define NAME=VALUE`
    * Define user-specific data for the config.userdata dictionary. Example: -D foo=bar to store it in config.userdata["foo"].
* `-e PATTERN, --exclude PATTERN`
    * Don't run feature files matching regular expression PATTERN.
* `-i PATTERN, --include PATTERN`
    * Only run feature files matching regular expression PATTERN.
* `--no-junit`
    * Don't output JUnit-compatible reports.
* `--junit`
    * Output JUnit-compatible reports. When junit is enabled, all stdout and stderr will be redirected and dumped to the junit report, regardless of the "-- capture" and "--no-capture" options.
* `--junit-directory PATH`
    * Directory in which to store JUnit reports.
* `-f FORMAT, --format FORMAT`
    * Specify a formatter. If none is specified the default formatter is used. Pass "--format help" to get a list of available formatters.
* --steps-catalog
    * Show a catalog of all available step definitions.
    * SAME AS: --format=steps.catalog --dry-run --no-summary -q
* `-k, --no-skipped`
    * Don't print skipped steps (due to tags).
* `--show-skipped`
    * Print skipped steps. This is the default behaviour.  This switch is used to override a configuration file setting.
* `--no-snippets`
    * Don't print snippets for unimplemented steps.
* `--snippets`
    * Print snippets for unimplemented steps. This is the default behaviour. This switch is used to override a configuration file setting.
* `-m, --no-multiline`
    * Don't print multiline strings and tables under steps.
* --multiline
    * Print multiline strings and tables under steps. This switch is used to override a configuration file setting.
    * true by default
* `-n NAME, --name NAME`
    * Only execute the feature elements which match part of the given name. If this option is given more than once, it will match against all the given names.
* `--no-capture`
    * Don't capture stdout (any stdout output will be printed immediately.)
* `--capture`
    * Capture stdout (any stdout output will be printed if there is a failure.)
    * This is the default behaviour.
    * This switch is used to override a configuration file setting.
* --no-capture-stderr
    * Don't capture stderr (any stderr output will be printed immediately.)
* `--capture-stderr`
    * Capture stderr (any stderr output will be printed if there is a failure.)
    * This is the default behaviour.  This switch is used to override a configuration file setting.
* `--no-logcapture`
    * Don't capture logging. Logging configuration will be left intact.
* `--logcapture`
    * Capture logging. All logging during a step will be captured and displayed in the event of a failure. This is the default behaviour. This switch is used to override a configuration file setting.
* `--logging-level LOGGING_LEVEL`
    * Specify a level to capture logging at.
    * The default is INFO - capturing everything.
* `--logging-format LOGGING_FORMAT`
                        Specify custom format to print statements. Uses the
                        same format as used by standard logging handlers. The
                        default is "%(levelname)s:%(name)s:%(message)s".
* `--logging-datefmt LOGGING_DATEFMT`
                        Specify custom date/time format to print statements.
                        Uses the same format as used by standard logging
                        handlers.
* `--logging-filter LOGGING_FILTER`
                        Specify which statements to filter in/out. By default,
                        everything is captured. If the output is too verbose,
                        use this option to filter out needless output.
                        Example: --logging-filter=foo will capture statements
                        issued ONLY to foo or foo.what.ever.sub but not foobar
                        or other logger. Specify multiple loggers with comma:
                        filter=foo,bar,baz. If any logger name is prefixed
                        with a minus, eg filter=-foo, it will be excluded
                        rather than included.
                        or other logger. Specify multiple loggers with comma:
                        filter=foo,bar,baz. If any logger name is prefixed
                        with a minus, eg filter=-foo, it will be excluded
                        rather than included.
* `--logging-clear-handlers`
    * Clear all other logging handlers.
* `--no-summary`
    * Don't display the summary at the end of the run.
* `--summary`
    * Display the summary at the end of the run.
* `-o FILE, --outfile FILE`
    * Write to specified file instead of stdout.
* `-q, --quiet`
    * Alias for --no-snippets --no-source.
* `-s, --no-source`
    * Don't print the file and line of the step definition with the steps.
* `--show-source`
    * Print the file and line of the step definition with the steps.
    * true by default.
* `--stage STAGE`
    * Defines the current test stage. The test stage name is used as name prefix for the environment file and the steps directory (instead of default path names).
* `--stop`
    * Stop running tests at the first failure.
* `-t TAG_EXPRESSION, --tags TAG_EXPRESSION`
                    Only execute features or scenarios with tags matching
                    TAG_EXPRESSION. Pass "--tags-help" for more
                    information.
* `-T, --no-timings`
    * Don't print the time taken for each step.
* `--show-timings`
    * Print the time taken, in seconds, of each step after
                    the step has completed. This is the default behaviour.
                    This switch is used to override a configuration file
                    setting.
* `-v, --verbose`
    * Show the files and features loaded.
* `-w, --wip`
    * Only run scenarios tagged with "wip".
    * Additionally: use the "plain" formatter, do not capture stdout or
                    logging output and stop at the first failure.
* `-x, --expand`
    * Expand scenario outline tables in output.
* `--lang LANG`
    * Use keywords for a language other than English.
* `--lang-list`
    * List the languages available for --lang.
