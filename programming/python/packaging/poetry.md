```
```


new                    Creates a new Python project at <path>.

```
```

init                   Creates a basic pyproject.toml file in the current directory.

```

```

`show` command creates virtualenv in your local computer if it doesn't exist.

```
poetry show <package>
```

* --no-dev               Do not list the development dependencies.
* -t (--tree)            List the dependencies as a tree.
* -l (--latest)          Show the latest version.
* -o (--outdated)        Show the latest version but only for packages that are outdated.
* -a (--all)             Show all packages (even those not compatible with current system).


install                Installs the project dependencies.

install packages to virtualenv for the project.
The install command reads the `poetry.lock` file from the current directory, processes it, and downloads and installs all the libraries and dependencies outlined in that file. If the file does not exist it will look for `pyproject.toml` and do the same.
Even if `poetry.lock` exist, `pyproject.toml` also needs to exists.

```
poetry instasll
```

* --no-dev               Do not install the development dependencies.
* --no-root              Do not install the root package (the current project).
* --dry-run              Output the operations but do not execute anything (implicitly enables --verbose).
* -E (--extras)          Extra sets of dependencies to install. (multiple values allowed)


build                  Builds a package, as a tarball and a wheel by default.

```
poetry build
```

* -f (--format)          Limit the format to either sdist or wheel.


The publish command builds and uploads the package to a remote repository.
Publish will fail if `build` is not executed before.

```
poetry publish
```

* -r (--repository)      The repository to publish the package to.
* -u (--username)        The username to access the repository.
* -p (--password)        The password to access the repository.
* --cert                 Certificate authority to access the repository.
* --client-cert          Client certificate to access the repository.
* --build                Build the package before publishing.


`config` manages `poetry.yaml`.

```
poetry config [<key>] [<value1>] ... [<valueN>]
```

* --list                 List configuration settings.
* --unset                Unset configuration setting.
* --local                Set/Get from the project's local configuration.


version                Shows the version of the project or bumps it when a valid bump rule is provided.
The version command shows the current version of the project or bumps the version of the project and writes the new version back to pyproject.toml if a valid bump rule is provided.

The new version should ideally be a valid semver string or a valid bump rule: patch, minor, major, prepatch, preminor, premajor, prerelease.

```
# show current project version
poetry versoin
# bump current project version
poetry versoin <version-name>
```

## Usage

```
poetry config --local repositories.staging https://foo.bar/simple/
poetry config --unset repositories.foo
```

## Configuration
There are project configuraton file `pyproject.toml` and poetry configuration file `poetry.yaml`.
