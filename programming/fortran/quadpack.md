## QUADPACK
numerical integration library written in fortran77.

## Methods
* qags
* qagi
    * general-purpose routine for infinite intervals
    * inifite interval is mapped to (0, 1]
    * use `qags` with 15-point
* qng
    * simple non-adaptive integrator
* qag
* qagp
* qawo
* qawf
* qas
* qawc

* QUADPACK is not maintained anymore
* last update is in 1987
* GNU Scientific Library reimplement QUADPACK
* written in fortran77
* GSL documentation is helpful
