Dear Rafi,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Talent Operations position at Pramp. I am excited by Pramp’s mission to build a platform on which individuals can gain and share knowledge in real time through being matched with peers with common interests.
Within the organizations I have served, I have consistently searched for ways to improve organizational capacity, reach new audiences, and engage key stakeholders. While at Princeton, I held leadership positions in two very different organizations: Princeton’s Sigma Chi chapter and the J Street U movement. I made a commitment to educating myself about the function of every role in these organizations in order to maximize my effectiveness.
From each of these positions, I will bring both internal management and strategic decision-making skills, in addition to a strong eagerness to learn and grow at Pramp. I hope that I will be able to share more about my experiences with you soon.
Thank you,
Justin Vogel
