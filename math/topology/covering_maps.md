## Covering Maps

* $E$,
    * toplogical sp.
* $X$,
    * toplogical sp.
* $\pi:E \rightarrow X$

#### Definition
$U$ is said to be evenly covered by $\pi$ if

$\pi^{-1}(U) \cong U$ by $\pi$.

<div class="end-of-statement" style="text-align: right">■</div>

#### Definition
$\pi$ is said to be covering map if

* $E$ and $X$ are connected,
* $E$ and $X$ are locally path-connected
* $\pi$ is surjective
* $\pi$ is continuous
* $p \in X$ has a neighborhood $U$ that is evenly covered by $\pi$

In this case,

* $X$ is called the base of the covering
* $E$ is called a covering space of $X$,
