### Process
* 1
    * One phone tech screen which covered both SQL and Python questions.
    * They do the best job I've seen of hosting this tech screen / interview.
    * They use CoderPad, and actually let you run the queries / functions.
    * For SQL they provide a nice schema for you to reference. And for coding (python) they provide basicâ€¦ 

* 2
    * Had a single phone interview, The interview was a poor experience.
    * First, The interviewer never cared about what i did in my job.
    * This should be the most important question for experienced people,but dint even see my resume.
    * For the questions ,they were along the same lines as the other interviews.
    * The interviewer basically had 5 questions already in the editor before i even started.
    * I tried to solve them as quickly as possibly,but was able to complete only 3 because of the detailed explanation i gave(probably a mistake on my part).
    * After i solved the 3rd question(dint even ask algo for 4 and 5 coding)he pasted the 5 sql questions.
    * Managed to complete the 5 sql though.
    * The interviewer was quiet during the whole interview.
    * Think the expectation is to cram the solutions before hand and just write solutions even before reading the solution / your typing speed should be high.
    * Being an interviewer myself, feel the way some interviews are conducted are not good.
    * Time shouldnt be such a factor.
    * Assumption that if you code a problem in 15 minutes and other person takes 20 minutes,
    * the person taking 15 minutes would code/work more in a day is as good an assumption that a 200m distance runner would beat a marathon runner in a marathon race.
    * Hope my fellow interviewers get it sometime in future at least My second bad interview experience with Facebook and to top it all heard I cant interview for 1 year.
    * Love the company but think i have to re-evaluate if i want to ever experience their interview process again.
    * The recruiters were nice during the short process and would like to thank them.


* 2-2
    * Initially I had to submit an assessment, which I cleared, then I had to give a phone interview, which was basically to write code .
    * The interviewer was extremely rude, and not clear with his questions
* 2-1
    * 2 phone screens and then the onsite interview.
    * Phone screens are based on SQL and data modelling.
    * Onsite interviews are based on SQL, ETL, Data modelling and behavioral questions.
    * Overall, the experience was good except one of the onsite interviewers.
    * Total 5 onsite interviews. 4 of them were very nice. Good people to interact with.
    * Question
        1. SQL concepts - Joins etc.
        2. DWH concepts - Types of schemas etc.
        3. Scenario based behavioral concepts - How did you handle conflict with your managers at your previous workplace?  
* 2-3
    * First, the hiring manager contacted me on LinkedIn.
    * After which I was asked for my resume and then HR setup the technical phone screening.
    * Interviewer showed up about 10 mins late and took about 1 hour for the entire process.
    * Q
        * tell me about your work experience, current project etc.
        * their online SQL coding site.
        * Given sample tables and asked various questions involving Outer Joins & Cross Joins, Sub Queries, Query to fill missing data etc  
* 2-4
    * Q
        1. What is the most challenging problem you solved at your company?
        2. How did you go above and beyond your role to keep the customers or business owners of your project happy?
        3. What was a way you found a really innovative solution to a problem?  
    * The interview ended with 5 minutes for a Dimensional modelling problem.
    * The entire process was very non-standard compared to other big companies and when you don't move to the next level for such a technical role without even being tested on your technical skills you are bound to have some amount of resentment.
