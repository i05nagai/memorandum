### Service

### Feature Engineering
* why this component exist?
* which component this component communicate to?
* expected inputs
    * streaming
    * batch
* outputs
    * streaming
    * batch
* storage for this components
    * structured knowledge of data such as meaning of the URL
        * for instance, third party URL has information about page information implicitly
        * `http://example.com/items/1/1234`, `/1/` is item category such as clothes or games
* what does this component communicate to?

### Learning/Training

* reporting
    * measurements of models such as precisions, acuracy 
* feature selection
* sampling

### prediction

### A/B testing
