## 01-01. Axioms for Categories

A metagraph consists of objects $a, b, c, \ldots,$ arrows $f,g,h, \ldots,$ and two operations

- Domain, which assigns to each arrow $f$ an object $a = \mathrm{dom}f$,
- CoDomain, which assigns to each arrow $f$ an object $b = \mathrm{dom}f$,


A metacategory is a metagraph with two additional operations.

- Identity, which assigns to each object $a$ an arrow $\mathrm{id}_{a} = 1_{a}: a \rightarrow a$,
- Composition, which assigns to each pair $\langle g, f \rangle$ of arrows with $\mathrm{dom}g = \mathrm{cod}f$,


Associativity

$$
    k \circ (g \circ f)
    =
    (k \circ g) \circ f
    .
$$

Unit law

$$
    1_{b} \circ f
    =
    f,
    \
    g \circ 1_{b}
    =
    g
    .
$$
