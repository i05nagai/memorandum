# 18.1 Hamiltonian and Nonhamiltonian Graphs

#### Theorem 18.1
- $G$
    - hamiltonian graph
- $S \subseteq V(G)$,

Then

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    c(G - S)
    \le
    \|S\|
    \label{chap_18_01_hamiltonian_graph}
\end{eqnarray}
    .
$$

#### proof
Let $C$ be a Hamilton cycle of $G$.

Since $C$ is a cycle, $C - S$ has at most $\|S\|$ components.
$G - S$ has more edges than $C - S$ so $G - S$ has at most $\|S\|$ components.
