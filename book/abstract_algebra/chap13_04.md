## 13-04 Splitting Fields and Algebraic Closures

### Definition. algebraic closure
* $F$,
    * field

$\bar{F}$ is said to be algebraic clusre over $F$ if

* (1) $\bar{F}$ is algebraic over $F$,
* (2) For every $f \in F[x]$, $f$ splits completely over $\bar{F}$,

### Definition. algebraically closed
* $F$,
    * field

$F$ is said to be algebraically closed if for every $f \in F$ the all roots of $f$ are in $F$.
