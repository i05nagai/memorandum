## 08.02 Principal ideal domains (P.I.D.s)


### Definition P.I.D.
* $R$,
    * integral domain

$R$ is said to be P.I.D. if every ideal $I$ is principal.

### Remark
* Porposition 1 in Seciton 8.2 proves every Euclidean Domain is a P.I.D.

### Proposition 7.
* $R$,
    * P.I.D.
* $(p) \neq 0 \subseteq R$,
    * prime ideal

Then $(p)$ is maimal ideal.

### proof.
Let $(p) \supseteq I = (m)$ be ideal containing $(p)$.
Since $p \in (m)$, $p = rm$ for some $r \in R$.
$p \in (p)$ and $(p)$ is prime ideal so that either $r \in (p)$ or $m \in (p)$ holds.

(i) $r \in (p)$.
In this case, $r = ps$ for some $s \in R$.
$p = rm = psm$.
$R$ is integral domain so that $sm = 1$.
Hence $m$ is unit so that $(m) = I$.

(ii) $m \in (p)$.
In this case, $(p) = (m) = I$.

### Corollary 8.
* $R$,
    * commutative ring,

If $R[x]$ is a P.I.D. or Eucliean Domain, then $R$ is a field.

### proof.
Suppose that $R[x]$ is a P.I.D..
$R[x]$ is of course a integral domain.
Since $R$ is a subring of $R[x]$, $R$ is a integral domain.
$R[x]/(x)$ is isomorphic to a integral domain $R$.
The ideal $(x)$ is a nonzero prime ideal in $R[x]$ by Proposition 13 in Seciton 7.4.
Since $R[x]$ is P.I.D., $(x)$ is a maximal ideal  by porposition 7.
By Proposition 12 in Section 7.4, $R[x]/(x)$ is field.
