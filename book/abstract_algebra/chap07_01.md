## 07-01. Basic definitions and examples

### Definition (Ring)
* $R$,
    * set
* $+$,
    * binary operator
    * addition
* $\times$,
    * binary operator
    * multiplication

$R$ is said to be ring if

* (i) $(R, +)$ is an abelian group
* (ii) $\times$ is associative: for all $a, b \in R$,
    * $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$,
* (iii) the distributive laws hold in $R$: for all $a, b, c \in R$,
    * $(a + b) \times c = (a \times c) + (b \times c)$,
    * $a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c)$.

The ring $R$ is said to be commmutative if 

* $R$ is commutative: for all $a, b \in R$,
    * $a \times b = b \times a$.

The ring $R$ is said to have an identity if

* there is an element $1 \in R$ such that for all $a \in R$,
    * $1 \times a = a \times 1 = a$,

### Definition (zero divisor, unit)
* $R$,
    * ring

$a \in R$ is said to be a zero divisor if 

$$
    \exist b \neq 0
    \text{ s.t. }
    ab = 0
    \text{ or }
    ba = 0
    .
$$

* $R$
    * ring with indentity

$u \in R$ is said to be a unit in $R$ if

$$
    \exists v \in R
    \text{ s.t. }
    uv = vu = 1
    .
$$

The set of units in $R$ is denoted $R^{\times}$.
