## AWS Certificate Manager



#### Certificate Transparency
- [Certificate Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/)

#### Common Name (CN)
- The Common Name (CN) is the fully qualified domain name of the Web server that will receive the certificate (e.g. www.entrust.com or buy.entrust.net). Do not include the protocol specifier (i.e., http:// or https://) or any port numbers or pathnames in the common name. Do not use wildcard characters such as ‘*’ or ‘?’, and do not use an IP address.
- Most Web browsers will display a warning message when connecting to your Web site if the Web server’s fully qualified domain name does not match the common name in the certificate.
