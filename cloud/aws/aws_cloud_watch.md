- from the previous 14 days to 15 months
- Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds: 3 hours
- 1 minute: 14 days
- 5 minutes: 63 days
- 1 hour: 455 days
- if you request for 1-minute data from 5 months back, the UI will automatically change the granularity to 1-hour and the GetMetricStatistics API will not return any output.
