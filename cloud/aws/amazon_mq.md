## Amazon MQ
Apache ActiveMQ on cloud.


* How Is Amazon MQ Different from Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS?
    * We recommend Amazon MQ for migrating applications from existing message brokers that rely on compatibility with APIs such as JMS or protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP.
    * Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS are queue and topic services that are highly scalable, simple to use, and don't require you to set up message brokers.
