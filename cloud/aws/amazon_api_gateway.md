## Amazon API Gateway

* API Gateway offers the way to manage API key and access control

## Concepts
* API Gateway
* API Gateway API
* API deployment
* API developer
* API endpoints
    * `{rest-api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com`
    * Edge-optimized API endpoint
        * best for geographically distributed clients.
        * API requests are routed to the nearest CloudFront Point of Presence (POP)
        * Edge-optimized APIs capitalize the names of HTTP headers (for example, Cookie).
    * Regional API endpoint
        * A regional API endpoint is intended for clients in the same region
        * When a client running on an EC2 instance calls an API in the same region, or when an API is intended to serve a small number of clients with high demands, a regional API reduces connection overhead
        * Regional and private APIs pass all header names through as-is.
    * Private API endpoint
        * an API endpoint that can only be accessed from your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using an interface VPC endpoint,
* API key
    * An alphanumeric string that API Gateway uses to identify an app developer who uses your API. 
* API owner
* API stage
    * Each stage is a snapshot of the API and is made available for client apps to call.
* App developer
* Integratin request
* Integration response
* Private API
* Private integration
* Proxy integration
* Usage plan
* Mapping template



## Lambda integration

## Pricing
[Amazon API Gateway â€“ Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/)

Example of pricing.
Price is based on 

* API calls
    * First 333 million per month
        * 3.50 usd per million
    * Next 667 million
        * 2.80 usd per million
    * Next 19 billion
        * 2.38 usd per million
    * Over 20 billion
        * 1.51 usd per million
* Caching
    * 0.5 GB
        * 0.02 USD per hour
    * 1.6 GB
        * 0.038 usd per hour
    * 6.1 GB
        * 0.20 usd per hour
    * 13.5 GB
        * 0.25 usd per hour
    * 28.4 GB
        * 0.50 usd per hour
    * 58.2 GB
        * 1.00 usd per hour
    * 118.0 GB
        * 1.90 usd per hour
    * 237.0 Gb
        * 3.80 usd per hour
* Transfer data
    * if you use other AWS services, the requests forwarded by API Gateway incurs costs in AWS service which receives the request, depending on the AWS service


## Enable logging in cloud watch
- [Enable CloudWatch Logs for API Gateway REST API or WebSocket API Troubleshooting](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/api-gateway-cloudwatch-logs/)
- [View API Gateway Log Events in the CloudWatch Console \- Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/view-cloudwatch-log-events-in-cloudwatch-console.html)

For a REST API, the log group's name is in this format: `API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_apiId/stageName`
For a WebSocket API, the log group's name is in this format: `/aws/apigateway/apiId/stageName`.

Additionally, `/aws/apigateway/welcome` log group might be create
